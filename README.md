#Explainable AI for Thyroid Disease Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc thesis project: "Explainable AI for Accurate and Transparent Thyroid Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning." The aim of this research is to build accurate machine learning models for thyroid disease classification while ensuring interpretability through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Thyroid disease is one of the most common endocrine disorders. Early and accurate detection is essential for effective treatment. Traditional black-box machine learning models provide high accuracy but lack transparency, making them less reliable in critical medical applications.

In this project, multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated on thyroid datasets. The best-performing model was XGBoost, which achieved high accuracy and robustness. Explainability was added using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) and other XAI techniques to provide insights into model predictions.
